# Configuration

## KUBECONFIG

If you specify the KUBECONFIG environment variable, it will try to use that path. Otherwise it uses the default path and context. Later I'll add the in cluster setup.

## SLACK_WEBHOOK

This must be configured in order for this to work. It's the environment variable `SLACK_WEBHOOK` set with a Slack integrations url.
